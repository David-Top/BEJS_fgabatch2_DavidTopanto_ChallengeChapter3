# Study Case

A bank wants to create a system to track information about its customers, accounts, and transactions. They want you to design a database that fits their needs.

## Entities

1. Customer
2. Account
3. Transactions

## Relations

1. One Customer can have several Accounts, but each Account can only be owned by one Customer.
2. One Account can have many Transactions, but each Transaction is only related to one Account.
